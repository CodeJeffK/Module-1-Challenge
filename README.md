# Module-1-Challenge

This repository contains starter code that has been refracted in order to meet the given Acceptance criteria.

In the first commit, multiple changes were made to the index.html file including adding a generic starting HTML format,
adding a reset.css, giving sections similar classes, and adding spaces and commentary in order to make it easier to read.

In second and third commits, changes were made to the style.css file in order to match the new classes and to make sure
it is in semantic order alongside the HTML file. The fourth commit is to add a screenshot of the deployed application.



Here is the web application's appearance and functionality:
